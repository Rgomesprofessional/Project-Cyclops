The Project Cyclops is a game that will give a complete experience for the players who has Sight Loss and it will make them fully enjoy a game by themselves. 

The target users will be people with visual impairment. The average age will be around 7 to 40 years old. It intends to incentive the inclusion in entertainment and allow two different “worlds” to come together and play without differences. 

The game will bring entertainment for people mainly for who have some Sight Loss. It can bring a feeling of acceptance to them into the society as players who suffers from some disability usually complain that games made for them are not challenging and this make them to feel underestimated. With the stress and pressure from nowadays the Project Cyclops also can assist to decrease depression and anxiety among young people and adults, especially if they already have an extra challenge being blind.
